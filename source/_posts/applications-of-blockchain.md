## Credentials

One of the most promising potentials of blockchain technology is in the realm of credentialing and user identification. Humans have utilized credentialing systems and dealt with issues of trust and verification for millennia. <!-- more --> Since 9th century Islamic scholars used an academic certificate called _ijâzah, _we have come a long way in identity confirmation; still, blockchain applications are fairly novel. Since blockchain is a securely encrypted and widely distributed timestamped ledger, many companies, organizations, and entities have been jumping at the opportunity to digitize and secure academic and alternative credentials, and use this technology to affirm identities in an immutable setting. 

For many entities, credentialing and identity verification is an arduous process that often can take months and still exhibit fundamental flaws. Throughout this section, we will explore some of the various applications of blockchain technology in credentialing, and see how this emerging technology is being used to tackle enormous problems such as identity fraud and systematic delays. Below, we delve into the diverse applications of blockchain technology to Health Credentialing, Voting Systems, and Academic Verifications.

### Health

Currently, physician credentialing normally takes 4 to 6 months to verify information like licenses, medical school and residency completion. During this time it takes to check credentials, it impedes the ability of health care professionals to deliver care. Any updates that need to be made take a long time and are difficult to verify. Additionally, different states have varying compliance regulations that can complicate the credentialing of medical professionals who want to relocate.

However, with blockchain, this credentialing could instead happen in real time. A study by J.P. Morgan estimated that blockchain could save as much as 80% of the current cost and time invested in physician credentialing today. Since the blockchain can be verified and updated, it would be a secure system to check medical credentials. Additionally, certain parts of the blockchain can be restricted. Users can only access certain parts of the blockchain in order to ensure that a hospital is only looking at the relevant credentials for the doctor or nurse they are trying to hire.

#### Clinical Trials

There are many information transactions that take place today in clinical trials. First, the coordinators of a clinical trial must find patients that are eligible for the study and spread the word about the trial that is occuring in order to find participants. Then, doctors must transfer the medical history of the patients to the coordinators of the trial and relay the treatment course to the participants. Insurance companies must also be updated about the process and treatment in order to cover the cost of the trial. Doctors must be supplied the medicine to give to the patients who are part of the trial and then must relay changes in the patients’ health or status because of the drugs being administered.

With blockchain, many of these processes can be made faster, more efficient, and more secure. Blockchain can improve communications between doctors, patients, and clinical trial coordinates throughout all stages of the trial process. Additionally, because it is secure and a safe way to store data, it eliminates risk of fraud or errors in data. This ensures that results are truthful and accurately represent any health changes as well as protects from data tampering. Data is shareable yet maintains patient privacy because you can restrict access so that medical history can be shared without any identities being exposed. This way, relevant data about patients can be shared with the trial coordinators without having other private identifying or contact information being shared. Overall, blockchain use in clinical trials could ultimately lead to cheaper drugs for consumers because clinical trials would be able to be done faster and more securely, and thus the cost to create a new drug would be decreased.

### Academic Credential Verification

One of the main goals of blockchain technology is the distribution and decentralization of information and resources, and the elimination of intermediaries. As blockchain has spread to various sectors, it has broken into academia in the form of credentialing. A shift from institution-accredited information to student-controlled distribution would empower a generation of students, as it would enable individuals to hold share things such as certificates, degrees, and transcripts in a safe, tamperproof, and trusted manner. Since blockchain is a secure digital ledger of transactions, students would be able to add accomplishments and certifications as a link on this chain, which they could then share with employers, continued education, and other entities. Thus, this could eliminate the universities’ role in continuously validating credentials. Furthermore, a standardized credentialing system would give employers, researchers, and institutions a broader, more heuristic realm of possibility when engaging with students and graduates.

As of April 2019, a coalition of nine accredited universities have been piloting a program experimenting with digital credentialing through blockchain, including MIT, Harvard, and UC Berkeley. According to an article by EdScoop, “The universities plan to develop a free service through which students can store and share academic credentials from various sources.” The project has the goal of facilitating a global infrastructure to record and validate academic achievements. Most excitingly, it seems academic credentialing is already gaining trust. According to a report by the edtech company Ellucian, 52% of employers and 58% of students surveyed responded they trusted digital credentials. While this sector has a substantial amount to develop and gain steam, blockchain applications in academic credentialing has the ability to revolutionize the way the academia interacts with the rest of the world, and can potentially create a brand new infrastructure in validating academic achievements.

### Voting - **Alma**

America, among many other countries, has consistently struggled to optimize the most critical aspect of a functioning democracy: voting. In 2016, individuals in Arizona had to wait up to 5 hours to vote in just one primary election, due to voting stations closing to avoid costs. In the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia, a flawed voter registration law kept an estimated 87,000 people from voting in a highly contested race. Currently, there are 19 states that do not require any type of identification from voters prior to voting in a federal election, and there are an estimated 6.9 million overlapping voter registrations. Furthermore, a Princeton professor demonstrated that the innate vulnerabilities in voting machines allow for the removal of the machines memory card, which, if infected with malicious code, could easily steal millions of votes within minutes. It is not disputed that the United States has a long history of systematic voter suppression, flawed registration processes, widespread voter fraud, inconsistent voter ID laws, and vulnerabilities in voting technologies. In a rapidly evolving democracy, voting must be standardized and secured to allow for just and accurate elections. The question remains; how can innovative technologies help fix our voting system?

Here is where blockchain enters the picture. In Utah in 2016, Blockchain technology was used for the first time in a state election, when Smartmatic, a British online voting company, enabled 59,000 individuals to vote online in the Republican Primary Caucus. The voting took place through a private blockchain utilizing end-to-end encryption to secure the votes. Through facial recognition and key-encrypted user verification, voters are credentialed in private blockchain using personal keys. Thus, when individuals vote, they use their verified identity to add a vote “block” to the chain and ensure their vote is immutable and permanent. Smartmatic’s program director Mike Summer’s was quoted saying this on the matter; “Who thinks the notion of requiring people to go to a particular location at a particular time on a particular day and use a pencil and a piece of paper which is then counted by hand is a good idea? It just seems at odds with how we lead our lives today.” This emerging technology also allowed Utah citizens to vote overseas in 2019, using the Voatz app. 

While promises of secure, standardized voting are enough for many to jump on the blockchain train, there are serious cybersecurity flaws that must be addressed before widespread implementation can happen. Malware on individual devices is a foremost concern in online voting, in which data and votes can be stolen and/or manipulated by malicious parties, since personal devices are nearly impossible to secure. Additionally, many user verification technologies are underdeveloped to the point of near non-viability; facial recognition has high rates of error among minority individuals, as the recognition databases lack diverse data. Finally, the secrecy maintained in our current voting system is meant to ensure elections and votes themselves cannot be bought. If there is a permanent online record of who voted for who, serious ethical questions can be raised about rigged elections. While there have been significant steps taken to innovate our voting system, the infrastructure is not yet ready to be implemented on a large scale in federal elections. Still, blockchain remains an incredibly promising venture for the future of voting.

## Cryptocurrency/Finance

**Samuel and Anna**

Money became an abstract concept when its value became independent from the gold standard. Today, money has no store of value, hence it is only "a matter of belief” in the value of it. To unravel the definition of money, it is important to understand the three roles that money has. These roles used to be interconnected but now these three pillars are looked at independently: a unit of value, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. Through cryptocurrency, these three pillars could become once again interconnected as it has a unit of value, medium of exchange and a store of value. 

This field holds by far the most developed and widely-known applications of blockchain.  While technology enthusiasts often argue that cryptocurrencies are the inevitable future of financial transactions, there are many notable skeptics who believe they are nothing more than another financial bubble about to burst. No matter on which side you stand, it is essential to better understand the potential and shortcomings of crypto. In this section, we will address this in three main topics: global development, international trade, and digital assets. 

Cryptocurrency is a new software technology market, which has continuously been changing since it began to be developed in 2008. There are constant changes of algorithms, and the mechanics behind cryptocurrency are constantly developing. Hence, this is not representative of the future—as cryptocurrency is an ongoing issue where data is changing and new information and articles are produced about it every day. 


### International Trade

In 2018, the global volume of exports reached an all-time high of 19.5 trillion dollars, approximately 23% of the world’s GDP.  For centuries, international trade has allowed people from all corners of the world to elevate their standard of living: Latin Americans drive cars made in Japan, Africans wear clothes made in Bangladesh, Europeans consume oranges harvested in California. In every possible perspective, international trade and specialization due to comparative advantage have been two of the driving forces behind global economic growth. That said, processes for international trade are still far from simple: even now, they are almost entirely paper-based, and most countries impose high restrictions on goods imported from other countries.

As you can guess, blockchain can play a major role in facilitating international transactions in the coming years. Particularly, by keeping track of all the paperwork, blockchain makes transactions more timely, easier to manage and less prone to losses. Also, blockchain’s consensus protocols significantly reduce the likelihood of fraud, as the majority of participants of a transaction have to consent on certain information for it to be uploaded to the blockchain. 

Furthermore, with the use of smart contracts, international trade can become faster and more reliable. Once certain conditions are triggered, the contract is automatically executed, precisely and irrevocably. Under a regime of smart contracts, for instance, it’s impossible for a buyer to not pay the seller after receiving all the imported goods. You can get more information on Smart Contracts in this link (link for the article on Smart Contracts). 

Another important use of blockchain in international trade is related to trade restrictions. By the comprehensive tracking of a product’s supply chain, blockchain enables countries to quickly and reliably check if a good meets their standards. This applies to most environmental, safety, and quality standards. Consider the restriction the European Union imposes on the import of poultry. By using a blockchain supply ledger, EU regulators could know exactly where every bird comes from, as well as their sanitary and transportation conditions. This would allow bureaucrats to make smarter and more accurate decisions.

In the coming future, the applications of blockchain in international trade will contribute to a safer, quicker and more vibrant world of global transactions.
