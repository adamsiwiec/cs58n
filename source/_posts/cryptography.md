To first understand cryptography, we must first understand hash functions.  Hash functions are mathematical functions used to convert input values into output values that are irreversible.

Blockchain uses a type of cryptography called public key cryptography.  It is a system that uses a pair of keys called the public key and the private key.  Each individual has each their two pairs; however, the private key is never to be shared.  This form of cryptography is used to encrypt messages between two people securely.  Any public key can be used for encryption, but to decrypt any message would need the public key that is associated with it.  Visually:

This is particularly important for blockchain technology because much of the information stored ought to be kept private (such as who conducted a financial transaction), so blockchainâ€™s usability is reliant on the ability to keep this information private to all but the owner.
