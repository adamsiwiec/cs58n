### Global development

>It truly is a currency without boundaries, that can empower people and connect a new global economy.” - Nicolas Kokkalis
<!-- more --> 

Cryptocurrency is an excellent alternative for countries facing an unstable currency that need to secure their assets. It can empower people in developing countries as it facilitates low-cost remittances, and allows people to have a decentralized global bank account where transactions between countries or even between merchants and consumers are facilitated and free of charge. This would take off a financial burden for low-income citizens, as they would be able to make transactions, remittances and lend money without facing high fees. 

“I keep all of my money in Bitcoin. Keeping it in bolívars would be financial suicide: the last time I checked, the rate of daily inflation was around 3.5 percent. That’s only daily inflation; the annual inflation rate for 2018 was almost 1.7 million percent.” Carlos Hernández, a Venezuelan economist, had suffered financial instability due to Venezuela’s hyperinflation, but “cryptocurrencies saved [his] family”. Cryptocurrency allowed people in Venezuela to have financial stability, accessibility and make transactions without causing a financial burden. This provided sovereignty to Venezuelans’ finance without the continuously hyperinflating economy impacting  their financial status. 

People in failed societies need a way to back up their own assets so that they do not rely on the government to be financially stable. Countries with an unstable and untrustworthy financial system will be able to perhaps have a stable economy through the use of a global digital currency. This ongoing need for a global currency that is accessible to people has created a movement away from a centralized system to a decentralized system, which is the basis of cryptocurrency: a digital currency available to everyone. Cryptocurrency is considered to be a financial instrument that eliminates the third man/institution; it is an abstract unit that can be used for a token of exchange by anyone with access to the internet. Through cryptocurrency, people could bypass institutional fees, intrusions and obstructions. Cryptocurrency would make money transnational, provide a platform for transactions that are low-cost at a microeconomic and macroeconomic scale, give financial accessibility to citizens with digital access, and even give stability and security to people living in financially unstable countries.  Hence, cryptocurrency has been able to provide people sovereignty and agency over their own finances, giving them more stability, so regardless of the country’s financial market they can always be financially stable.  This digital currency could then have an impact on people in developing countries, with no financial access, unstable currencies, and high transaction fees (which is a burden especially for low-income citizens). 

Nevertheless, there is a certain irony. Blockchain technology is potentially most useful in situations where there are weak institutions and parties who cannot easily trust each other—for example, in a setting like Zimbabwe, with low state capacity and low trust amidst conflict—but such countries are also often in the weakest position to effectively implement such technology. In the short term cryptocurrency is the best alternative to provide financial stability for people living in countries who are facing an unstable government and currency. However, in the long term, it could have a greater detrimental effect on the local economy as all savings and assets are taken out of the economy, and hence provoke the economy to collapse faster. The government is incompetent of preventing people from moving all of their assets to crypto and taking their money out of the local economy. Hence, cryptocurrency could in the end have greater negative unintended consequences as it would cause the local economy to collapse faster, which would eventually negatively impact the citizens even more. However, could a global currency fix this problem if everyone uses the same digital global currency, where local money would not be withdrawn from the country? Governments need to work concurrently with cryptocurrency internationally, and perhaps even adopt a national cryptocurrency themselves based off a decentralized network where they can still control their economy, and avoid a complete collapse of the economy. But now the question is how would we build a decentralized governance system that gives people a true voice in the decentralized technology systems while still enabling people to be financially stable? 

Cryptocurrency has been able to give the citizens power to control the currency of the country, which can create tension and complexities culturally, politically and economically. Therefore, technologists, politicians, historians, economists must all work together to find a stable and successful financial digital platform that could help people in developing countries, especially countries facing a financial crisis. There is still hope that this can be done through blockchain; as Brian Singer states, “blockchain encryption has a greater ability to bring more of the world's population out of poverty than anything we have ever seen”. However, for this to be possible we must work together for a bright future.

### Digital Assets and Investing

Someone who invested 100 dollars in Bitcoin in February 2010 and kept it for 10 years would now have accumulated over 9.2 million dollars. To put this in perspective, an equal investment in Amazon stock would now be worth a little less than 4,000 dollars, and in Warren Buffet’s legendary Berkshire Hathaway a little less than 400 dollars. Even if you believe cryptocurrencies are nothing more than a financial fad, you must admit these are some quite astonishing returns. 

With interest rates at all-time lows, rising global debt, and growing distrust in Central Banks worldwide, digital assets have become an attractive class for many investors. The ability to hold an asset not controlled by any government or central authority appeals to some as the best hedge against the possibility of another massive financial crisis. Furthermore, with the intensification of global migration, cryptocurrencies emerge as a simple and reliable way of securing assets wherever you are in the world. For those who had to leave Syria very quickly during its humanitarian crisis, for example, emergency reserves in crypto would have served as good protection against having to leave all their money in Syrian banks behind. In some ways, investing in cryptocurrencies is defending yourself from the state’s desire for increasing power.

And Bitcoin is just one of many different cryptocurrencies. Others include Ethereum, Ripple, BCash, and Litecoin. Yet, a feature common to most cryptocurrencies is skyrocketing volatility. It is not uncommon for values to change by 10% in a single day. This creates a new challenge for investors worldwide: if we are truly moving toward a world of crypto, we might have to create stabler ways of storing it. Still, while some investors are unwavering in their belief in cryptocurrencies, many more remain skeptical. In a 2019 interview, Warren Buffett explained one of the reasons why he will never own a single cryptocurrency: “You can’t do anything with it except sell it to somebody else”. Billionaire Mark Cuban has also said publicly that cryptocurrencies hold no “intrinsic value” and that Facebook is making a “big mistake” moving forward with Libra. That said, the best investments in history, as even Buffett would agree, have been the most contrarian. Maybe crypto is just one more.

## Supply Chain

Using blockchain as a supply chain management system is one of the most exciting applications of blockchain. It can greatly increase “transparency into the provenance of consumer goods— from the source point to end consumption” to ensure that all goods being shipped are tracked and logged from their origin. In addition, blockchain is extremely secure and can help prevent fraudulent products from reaching the shelves. 

For example, in today’s container industry, “paperwork can account for half the cost of transport.” With an efficient blockchain system, this cost can be greatly decreased, lowering product costs to consumers. Additionally, more that “2% of global economic output results from counterfeiting revenues” and a study conducted by Oceana in 2010 to 2012 showed that “seafood is mislabeled up to 87% of the time.” Blockchain is secure and restricts editing access to only the people who should be editing a product and its location or status, thus making this system much more efficient and safer.

### Aviation

As odd as it may initially seem, aviation is one of the industries hiding the most potential for blockchain disruption in the near future. Think about it: when it comes to airplanes, it is essential to have the most timely, precise, and reliable data possible. And there’s no better way to do this than through a distributed ledger or blockchain. In this article, we will divide the applications of blockchain in aviation into three main categories: customer relations, aircraft maintenance, and asset management. 

_Customer Relations_: even though loyalty programs have become one of the most important aspects of modern-day commercial travel, they are still full of issues: from big delays for miles to be posted to loyalty accounts to the difficulty of finding actual good uses for your frequent flyer miles, there are many ways in which our loyalty experiences could be made better. Blockchain can help with this. By time-stamping a traveler’s itinerary, for instance, it can make mileage accrual instantaneous. Also, blockchain has the potential to tokenize frequent flyer miles, which would give consumers much more choice and flexibility. We might not be too far from the day in which we’ll be able to pay for groceries, electronics, and even restaurant meals with airline miles.

_Aircraft maintenance_: maintenance logs are still done in paper, which makes important aircraft information very hard to access and analyze. With blockchain, we can keep close track of the history and condition of every single part of an airliner, as well as maintain an unalterable record of everyone going in and out of a plane. This helps assure maximum travel safety. Blockchain can also move aircraft maintenance from a corrective process, mostly conducted when a problem arises, to a preventive process, conducted even before anything happens.

_Asset management_: with its detailed record of every single part of a commercial airliner, blockchain can significantly increase the accuracy of aircraft insurance pricing. Also, by improving maintenance processes, it can improve aircraft availability and therefore increase airlines’ revenues. Blockchain can also impact the secondary market for airplanes.  Whenever an aircraft gets resold nowadays, it has to be torn apart and evaluated piece-by-piece. By offering a more accurate assessment of an aircraft’s condition, blockchain can greatly increase resale aircraft value.

### Health drugs

Currently, the Electronic Data Interchange is the one of the few central databases to track where drugs come from. This database connects distributors to manufacturers, but has many issues in its current implementation. The system is not optimized for the large number of users it has and it is quite costly. Additionally, transactions on the Electronic Data Interchange do not happen in real-time so updates can be quite slow. The system is also lacking in its security and is prone to data breaches and counterfeit drugs.

With blockchain, medical institutions can easily see how a product travels from the manufacturer to the dispenser. If there are any tainted drugs, medical institutions could find where the original source is and stop any more people from obtaining the drugs immediately. Additionally, since blockchain is secure, this can also stop drug counterfeiting to ensure that all drugs are safe and come from the correct places. It can also prevent confidential information from being leaked with utilization of zero knowledge proofs. In fact, after completing a pilot program with the US Food and Drug Administration, “25 leading pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors, logistic partners, and other representatives of the pharma supply chain have published a report arguing in favor of adopting blockchain technology to track and trace prescription drugs.” Movement has already started towards utilizing blockchain to track drugs in the health sphere and will hopefully continue as blockchain technology becomes more mainstream.

### Food and Produce

How will blockchain make an impact on our food system? Blockchain's capability of tracking ownership records and tamper-resistance can be used to solve urgent issues such as food fraud, safety recalls, supply chain inefficiency and food traceability in the current food system. The most common use of blockchain in food and agriculture supply chains is to improve traceability; however it can also have several other uses, such as data transparency, balancing the food market and creating more responsibility within the industry. In terms of traceability it enables companies to quickly track unsafe products back to their source and see where else they have been distributed, in order to maintain a solid reputation by protecting their consumers through placing their health as a priority. This will be possible with the upcoming application of blockchain in the food supply chain, which further has the potential to prevent illness and save lives, as well as reduce the cost of product recalls.

Food traceability is the center of food safety, because the food industry is extremely vulnerable to making mistakes that would ultimately affect human lives, such as when a foodborne disease threatens the  public health, the first step to root-cause analysis is to track down the source of contamination and there is no tolerance for uncertainty. This tracking must be done to protect future consumers, in order to locate the area that was supplying food that causes foodborne disease and then stop production until finding a solution to the foodborne disease. Currently, we have a tracking system that is costly, slow, and not reliable as it is hard to keep track of so much data. Nevertheless, blockchain is able to solve all of these problems, hence in the long run keeping the public’s health strong. Furthermore, blockchain also adds value to the current market by establishing a ledger in the network and balancing market pricing. Farmers are able to access correct and exact data on how much consumers want and how much they are willing to pay for it. This will help create a market with a stable equilibrium, where farmers and consumers will maximize their surplus, by eliminating third parties and creating a marketplace with immense transparency.. Furthermore, companies that buy or invest in agricultural products have an inherent interest in having information about the product before they commit to a purchase. Hence, blockchain will be able to reveal this data about the supply chain, perhaps increasing sales as companies and individuals will be more confident about their investment/purchase as they will have access to the supply chain.

For example, Walmart has started to use a blockchain to track the source of their fresh food. They claim that the time needed to “trace the firm’s provenance has dropped from seven days to just 2.2 seconds,” a very dramatic shift. Because of this large decrease in the amount of time it takes to find the origins of various products, blockchain can help stop dangerous food contamination. For example, in June 2008, it was found that there were large “quantities of milk and infant formula across China adulterated with melamine”. This resulted in over 300,000 people being affected, with 6 babies dying and another 54,000 being hospitalized. Because it was difficult to track where the infected products were coming from, contaminated products continued to be sold and spread over China. With blockchain, since it is so fast to track where products originate, an outbreak like this can be prevented. 

There are already blockchain companies that are deeply invested in the food sector, such as Bext360 which utilizes a combination of IoT, blockchain, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to build a fully-transparent food supply chain. This company has been able to provide the SaaS platform to growers and different players along the value chain for sharing data and tracking progress.
